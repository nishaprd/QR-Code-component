## My process
1) I have used div containers , for main body as well as QR card and for the elements inside QR card as well
2) Used flexbox for main body, and aligned the qr card inside it to center.
3) Used padding inside the qr-card .

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Learnt how to make page responsive , % vs VH/VW , what is the default height of body. 
- Tried different cases , to understand how min-height / height works with vh or %, documented them in local file.

### Useful resources

- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-page-width-height/ - This helped to understand how to set width and height properties for our page to be responsive.
